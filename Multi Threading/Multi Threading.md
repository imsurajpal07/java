## 1. Introduction to Threads {#introduction}

### What is a Thread?

Imagine you're in a kitchen preparing a complex meal. You could do everything sequentially: chop vegetables, then cook rice, then prepare sauce, and so on. But that would be inefficient! Instead, you might put rice on to cook while chopping vegetables, and start the sauce while the rice is still cooking. This is essentially what threading does in programming.

A **thread** is like having multiple hands working simultaneously in your program. Technically, it's the smallest unit of execution that can run independently within a process. Think of a process as the entire kitchen, and threads as different cooks working simultaneously on different tasks.

### Why Do We Need Threads?

Let's consider a real-world scenario: you're building a web server. Without threads, your server could only handle one user request at a time. If one user uploads a large file (taking 30 seconds), every other user would have to wait! With threads, you can handle multiple requests simultaneously - one thread per request.

Here are the main benefits:

**1. Parallelism**: Multiple tasks can execute simultaneously on multi-core processors
**2. Responsiveness**: User interfaces remain responsive while background tasks run
**3. Resource Utilization**: Better use of CPU and I/O resources
**4. Asynchronous Processing**: Handle slow operations without blocking other tasks

### Understanding Threads vs Processes

Before we dive deeper, let's understand the fundamental difference:

**Process**: Think of this as a separate restaurant. Each restaurant has its own kitchen, dining area, and staff. Restaurants are completely isolated from each other.

**Thread**: Think of this as different cooks in the same kitchen. They share the same space, ingredients, and equipment, but work on different dishes simultaneously.

```
Process (Restaurant A)           Thread (Cooks in Kitchen)
┌─────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ │     │ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ │
│ │Stack│ │Heap │ │Code │ │     │ │Cook1│ │Cook2│ │Cook3│ │
│ └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘ │     │ └─────┘ └─────┘ └─────┘ │
│   Separate Memory       │     │    Shared Kitchen       │
└─────────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────────┘
```

## 2. Thread Basics {#basics}

### The Main Thread

Every Java program starts with something called the "main thread." This is like the head chef who starts the kitchen operations. When you run a Java program, the JVM creates this main thread to execute your `main()` method.

### Understanding Thread Properties

Every thread has several important properties:

- **Name**: An identifier (like "Thread-1" or a custom name like "DatabaseWorker")
- **ID**: A unique number assigned by the JVM
- **Priority**: A hint to the operating system about how important this thread is (1-10, with 5 being normal)
- **State**: The current condition of the thread (NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, etc.)
- **Daemon Status**: Whether this thread should prevent the JVM from shutting down

Let's see how to access information about the current thread:

```java
public class BasicThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get current thread (main thread)
        Thread mainThread = Thread.currentThread();
        System.out.println("Main thread: " + mainThread.getName());
        System.out.println("Main thread ID: " + mainThread.getId());
        System.out.println("Main thread priority: " + mainThread.getPriority());
        System.out.println("Is daemon: " + mainThread.isDaemon());
    }
}
```

### Thread States - The Journey of a Thread

Understanding thread states is crucial. Think of a thread like a person going through different phases of activity:

```
           NEW (Just Born)
            │
            ▼
         RUNNABLE (Ready to Work/Working)
        ┌────┴────┐
        ▼         ▼
    BLOCKED    WAITING/TIMED_WAITING
   (Waiting    (Taking a Break)
    for lock)       │
        │           │
        └─────┬─────┘
              ▼
          TERMINATED (Work Done)
```

- **NEW**: Thread object created but not started (like a person who exists but hasn't started working)
- **RUNNABLE**: Thread is ready to run or currently running (actively working or ready to work)
- **BLOCKED**: Thread is waiting for a lock to become available (waiting for permission to enter a room)
- **WAITING**: Thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action (waiting for a phone call)
- **TIMED_WAITING**: Thread is waiting for a specific amount of time (taking a scheduled break)
- **TERMINATED**: Thread has completed execution (finished work and went home)

## 3. Creating Threads in Java {#creating-threads}

Java provides multiple ways to create and run threads. Think of these as different ways to hire workers for your restaurant.

### Method 1: Extending the Thread Class

This is like creating a specialized worker who inherently knows they're a thread. The worker (your class) becomes a thread by inheriting Thread capabilities.

**When to use**: When you want to create a specialized thread class that will always be used as a thread.

**Pros**: Simple and straightforward
**Cons**: Uses inheritance (Java's single inheritance limitation), less flexible

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    private String threadName;
    
    public MyThread(String name) {
        this.threadName = name;
        // Set the thread name for easier debugging
        setName(name);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // This is the work the thread will do
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(threadName + " - Count: " + i);
            try {
                // Sleep for 1 second (simulates work being done)
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(threadName + " was interrupted");
                return; // Exit gracefully
            }
        }
        System.out.println(threadName + " finished execution");
    }
}

// Usage example
public class ThreadExample1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread1 = new MyThread("Thread-1");
        MyThread thread2 = new MyThread("Thread-2");
        
        thread1.start(); // Start thread1 (calls run() in a new thread)
        thread2.start(); // Start thread2 (calls run() in a new thread)
        
        System.out.println("Main thread continues execution");
        // Note: main thread doesn't wait for other threads to finish
    }
}
```

### Method 2: Implementing Runnable Interface (Recommended)

This is like hiring a worker and giving them a job description (Runnable). The worker isn't inherently a thread, but they can be assigned to work on a thread.

**When to use**: Almost always! This is the preferred approach.

**Pros**: More flexible (your class can extend another class), better separation of concerns, can be reused with different threading mechanisms
**Cons**: Slightly more verbose

```java
class MyTask implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;
    
    public MyTask(String name) {
        this.taskName = name;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // This is the actual work to be done
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(taskName + " - Count: " + i + 
                             " (Running on " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + ")");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(taskName + " was interrupted");
                return;
            }
        }
        System.out.println(taskName + " finished execution");
    }
}

// Usage
public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the tasks (job descriptions)
        MyTask task1 = new MyTask("Task-1");
        MyTask task2 = new MyTask("Task-2");
        
        // Create threads and assign tasks to them
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task1);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task2);
        
        // Give threads meaningful names
        thread1.setName("Worker-1");
        thread2.setName("Worker-2");
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

### Method 3: Using Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)

This is the modern, concise way - like giving quick instructions to a worker without writing a formal job description.

**When to use**: For simple, short-lived tasks that don't need a separate class.

**Pros**: Very concise, perfect for simple tasks
**Cons**: Not suitable for complex logic, harder to reuse

```java
public class LambdaThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread with lambda expression
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Lambda Thread - Count: " + i);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
        
        thread1.setName("Lambda-Worker");
        thread1.start();
        
        // Wait for the thread to complete before main thread exits
        try {
            thread1.join(); // join() makes main thread wait
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Main thread finished - all work completed");
    }
}
```

**Important Note**: Always call `start()`, never `run()` directly! Calling `run()` directly executes the code in the current thread (defeats the purpose), while `start()` creates a new thread and then calls `run()` in that new thread.

## 4. Thread Lifecycle {#lifecycle}

Understanding the thread lifecycle is like understanding the life of an employee in your company. Let's explore each state with practical examples.

### Thread States in Detail

Every thread goes through specific states during its lifetime. Understanding these states helps in debugging and optimizing your multithreaded applications.

**NEW**: A thread that has been created but not yet started. It's like a new employee who has been hired but hasn't started their first day of work yet.

**RUNNABLE**: This state actually encompasses two sub-states:
- **Ready**: The thread is ready to run but waiting for CPU time
- **Running**: The thread is currently executing

Think of this as an employee who is either actively working or ready to work when assigned a task.

**BLOCKED**: The thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock. Imagine an employee waiting outside a meeting room because it's currently occupied by another employee.

**WAITING**: The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action. Like an employee waiting for a colleague to finish a report before they can continue their work.

**TIMED_WAITING**: The thread is waiting for a specific amount of time or until another thread performs a specific action. Like an employee on a scheduled lunch break.

**TERMINATED**: The thread has completed execution. The employee has finished their work and gone home.

```java
public class ThreadLifecycleDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                System.out.println("Thread started - State: RUNNABLE");
                Thread.sleep(2000); // This puts thread in TIMED_WAITING state
                System.out.println("Thread woke up from sleep");
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread was interrupted during sleep");
                return;
            }
        });
        
        // Thread is created but not started
        System.out.println("Before start - State: " + thread.getState()); // NEW
        
        thread.start();
        System.out.println("After start - State: " + thread.getState()); // RUNNABLE
        
        // Wait a bit and check state during sleep
        Thread.sleep(500);
        System.out.println("During thread's sleep - State: " + thread.getState()); // TIMED_WAITING
        
        // Wait for thread to complete
        thread.join(); // This makes main thread wait
        System.out.println("After completion - State: " + thread.getState()); // TERMINATED
    }
}
```

### Understanding Thread Priority

Thread priority is like giving hints to your operating system about which threads are more important. However, it's important to understand that priority is just a hint - the OS scheduler makes the final decision.

**Priority Levels**:
- `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1): Lowest priority
- `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5): Default priority
- `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10): Highest priority

**Important**: Don't rely heavily on thread priorities for program correctness. Different operating systems handle priorities differently, and the behavior can be unpredictable.

```java
public class ThreadPriorityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread highPriorityThread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("High priority thread: " + i);
                // Yield to give other threads a chance
                Thread.yield();
            }
        });
        
        Thread lowPriorityThread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                System.out.println("Low priority thread: " + i);
                Thread.yield();
            }
        });
        
        // Set priorities (1 = MIN, 5 = NORM, 10 = MAX)
        highPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
        lowPriorityThread.setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY);
        
        lowPriorityThread.start();
        highPriorityThread.start();
        
        // Note: The output may not always show high priority thread executing first
        // Priority is just a hint to the scheduler
    }
}
```

### Daemon Threads

Daemon threads are like background service workers - they provide services to other threads but don't prevent the application from shutting down. When all non-daemon threads finish, the JVM will terminate, even if daemon threads are still running.

**Examples of daemon threads**: Garbage Collector, JIT compiler threads

**Use cases**: Background monitoring, logging, cleanup tasks

```java
public class DaemonThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (true) {
                System.out.println("Daemon thread running...");
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        });
        
        // Set as daemon thread BEFORE starting
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
        daemonThread.start();
        
        // Main thread sleeps for 3 seconds then exits
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        System.out.println("Main thread exiting...");
        
        // JVM will terminate even though daemon thread is still running
    }
}
```

## 5. Thread Synchronization {#synchronization}

Imagine you have a shared bank account with your roommate. If both of you try to withdraw money at the exact same time, without any coordination, you might both see the same balance and withdraw more than what's available. This is exactly what happens with threads accessing shared data - we call this a "race condition."

### The Problem: Race Conditions

A race condition occurs when multiple threads access shared data simultaneously, and the final result depends on the timing of their execution. It's called a "race" because threads are racing to access the data, and whoever wins affects the outcome.

Let's see this problem in action:

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    // This method is NOT thread-safe
    public void increment() {
        count++; // This looks simple but is actually 3 operations:
                 // 1. Read current value of count
                 // 2. Add 1 to it
                 // 3. Write the new value back to count
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class RaceConditionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Counter counter = new Counter();
        
        // Create 10 threads, each incrementing the counter 1000 times
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
        }
        
        // Start all threads
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.start();
        }
        
        // Wait for all threads to complete
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.join();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Expected: 10000, Actual: " + counter.getCount());
        // You'll likely see a number less than 10000 due to race condition!
    }
}
```

**Why does this happen?**
When two threads execute `count++` simultaneously:
1. Thread 1 reads count (let's say it's 100)
2. Thread 2 reads count (still 100, because Thread 1 hasn't written yet)
3. Thread 1 calculates 100 + 1 = 101
4. Thread 2 calculates 100 + 1 = 101
5. Thread 1 writes 101 to count
6. Thread 2 writes 101 to count
7. Result: count is 101 instead of 102 (we lost one increment!)

### Solution 1: Synchronized Methods

The `synchronized` keyword is like having a bouncer at a club - only one thread can enter the synchronized method at a time. When a thread is inside a synchronized method, all other threads must wait outside.

```java
class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    // Only one thread can execute this method at a time
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++; // Now this is thread-safe
    }
    
    // Also synchronize the getter for consistency
    public synchronized int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SynchronizedMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SynchronizedCounter counter = new SynchronizedCounter();
        
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
        }
        
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.start();
        }
        
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.join();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Expected: 10000, Actual: " + counter.getCount());
        // Now you should see exactly 10000!
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Synchronized Blocks

Sometimes you don't want to synchronize the entire method, just a specific part of it. Synchronized blocks give you more fine-grained control. It's like having multiple rooms in a house, each with its own lock.

```java
class SynchronizedBlockCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    private final Object lock = new Object(); // Explicit lock object
    
    public void increment() {
        // Some non-critical code can execute without synchronization
        System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " preparing to increment");
        
        // Only synchronize the critical section
        synchronized (lock) {
            count++;
        }
        
        // More non-critical code
        System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " finished incrementing");
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        synchronized (lock) {
            return count;
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits of synchronized blocks**:
- Better performance (less code is synchronized)
- More flexibility (you can use different locks for different operations)
- Clearer intent (shows exactly what needs protection)

### Solution 3: Using AtomicInteger

Sometimes synchronization can be overkill. For simple operations like incrementing a counter, Java provides atomic classes that handle thread-safety without explicit synchronization.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
    
    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation - thread-safe without synchronization
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
    
    // Atomic classes provide many useful methods
    public boolean compareAndSet(int expectedValue, int newValue) {
        return count.compareAndSet(expectedValue, newValue);
    }
}

public class AtomicExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        AtomicCounter counter = new AtomicCounter();
        
        Thread[] threads = new Thread[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 1000; j++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            });
        }
        
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.start();
        }
        
        for (Thread thread : threads) {
            thread.join();
        }
        
        System.out.println("Expected: 10000, Actual: " + counter.getCount());
        // Atomic operations guarantee the correct result!
    }
}
```

### The Deadly Embrace: Deadlock

Deadlock is like two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway, but each insists the other should go first, so nobody moves. In threading, it occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for the other to release a resource.

**Classic Deadlock Scenario**: Thread A holds Lock 1 and wants Lock 2, while Thread B holds Lock 2 and wants Lock 1. Neither can proceed!

```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1...");
                
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for lock 2...");
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding lock 1 & 2...");
                }
            }
        });
        
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) { // Different order - this causes deadlock!
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2...");
                
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for lock 1...");
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding lock 2 & 1...");
                }
            }
        });
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        
        // This program will hang forever due to deadlock!
    }
}
```

### Preventing Deadlock

The simplest way to prevent deadlock is to always acquire locks in the same order:

```java
public class DeadlockPrevention {
    private static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private static final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public static void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            System.out.println("Method1: Got lock1");
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Method1: Got lock2");
                // Do work with both resources
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void method2() {
        synchronized (lock1) { // Same order as method1!
            System.out.println("Method2: Got lock1");
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Method2: Got lock2");
                // Do work with both resources
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> method1());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> method2());
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        
        // No deadlock because both methods acquire locks in same order
    }
}
```

## 6. Inter-thread Communication {#communication}

Sometimes threads need to coordinate their work, like dancers in a ballet or musicians in an orchestra. Java provides several mechanisms for threads to communicate and coordinate with each other.

### The Producer-Consumer Problem

Imagine a bakery where one person (producer) makes bread and puts it on a shelf, while another person (consumer) takes bread from the shelf to sell. They need to coordinate:
- The producer should stop making bread if the shelf is full
- The consumer should wait if the shelf is empty
- They should notify each other when the situation changes

### Using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll()

These methods are like a communication system between threads. Think of them as a walkie-talkie system:
- `wait()`: "I'm going to sleep until someone wakes me up"
- `notify()`: "Wake up one person who's sleeping"
- `notifyAll()`: "Wake up everyone who's sleeping"

**Important Rules**:
1. These methods must be called from within a synchronized block/method
2. They must be called on the same object that you're synchronizing on
3. Always use `wait()` in a loop (check the condition again after waking up)

```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean available = false;
    
    public synchronized void produce() {
        // Wait until the item is consumed
        while (available) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Producer waiting... (shelf is full)");
                wait(); // Release the lock and wait until notified
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                return;
            }
        }
        
        // Produce the item
        available = true;
        System.out.println("Produced item (shelf now has bread)");
        notify(); // Wake up the consumer
    }
    
    public synchronized void consume() {
        // Wait until an item is available
        while (!available) {
            try {
                System.out.println("Consumer waiting... (shelf is empty)");
                wait(); // Release the lock and wait until notified
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                return;
            }
        }
        
        // Consume the item
        available = false;
        System.out.println("Consumed item (shelf now empty)");
        notify(); // Wake up the producer
    }
}

public class ProducerConsumerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();
        
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                resource.produce();
                try { 
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time to produce
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
        
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                resource.consume();
                try { 
                    Thread.sleep(1500); // Consumer is slower than producer
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
        
        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

### Modern Approach: BlockingQueue

While `wait()` and `notify()` work, they're error-prone and complex. Java provides higher-level utilities like `BlockingQueue` that handle the coordination for you. It's like having an automatic conveyor belt system in the bakery.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue;

public class BlockingQueueExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a queue that can hold maximum 5 items
        BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(5);
        
        // Producer thread
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Producing item: " + i);
                    queue.put(i); // Automatically blocks if queue is full
                    System.out.println("Produced item: " + i + " (Queue size: " + queue.size() + ")");
                    Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate production time
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Producer finished");
        });
        
        // Consumer thread
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                try {
                    Integer item = queue.take(); // Automatically blocks if queue is empty
                    System.out.println("Consumed item: " + item + " (Queue size: " + queue.size() + ")");
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Consumer is slower than producer
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Consumer finished");
        });
        
        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
    }
}
```

**Benefits of BlockingQueue**:
- Automatic blocking when full/empty
- Thread-safe operations
- No need to manage `wait()`/`notify()`
- Less error-prone code
- Multiple implementations available (`ArrayBlockingQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, etc.)

## 7. Thread Pools and Executors {#thread-pools}

Imagine you're running a restaurant. You could hire a new chef every time an order comes in and fire them when they're done, but that would be expensive and inefficient! Instead, you hire a fixed number of chefs who handle orders as they come in. This is exactly what thread pools do.

### The Problem with Creating Threads Manually

Creating a new thread for every task has several problems:
- **Performance overhead**: Creating and destroying threads is expensive
- **Resource exhaustion**: Too many threads can overwhelm the system
- **Hard to manage**: Difficult to control and monitor thread lifecycle

### Enter the Executor Framework

Java's Executor framework provides a high-level API for managing threads. Instead of creating threads directly, you submit tasks to an executor service, which manages a pool of worker threads for you.

**Think of it as**:
- **Executor**: The restaurant manager
- **Thread Pool**: The kitchen staff (chefs)
- **Tasks**: Individual orders
- **Queue**: The order queue where tasks wait

### ExecutorService - Your Thread Manager

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ExecutorServiceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a thread pool with 3 worker threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        
        System.out.println("Submitting 10 tasks to 3 worker threads...\n");
        
        // Submit 10 tasks to the executor
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " started by " + 
                                   Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    // Simulate work by sleeping
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " completed by " + 
                                       Thread.currentThread().getName());
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " was interrupted");
                }
            });
        }
        
        // Properly shutdown the executor
        System.out.println("All tasks submitted. Shutting down executor...");
        executor.shutdown(); // No new tasks accepted, but existing ones continue
        
        try {
            // Wait up to 60 seconds for existing tasks to complete
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                System.out.println("Forcing shutdown...");
                executor.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }
        
        System.out.println("All tasks completed. Executor shutdown complete.");
    }
}
```

**What happens here**:
1. We create a pool of 3 worker threads
2. We submit 10 tasks (more tasks than threads)
3. The first 3 tasks start immediately (one per thread)
4. Remaining 7 tasks wait in a queue
5. As threads finish their tasks, they pick up new ones from the queue

### Types of Thread Pools

Java provides several pre-configured thread pool types, each suited for different scenarios:

#### 1. Fixed Thread Pool
Like having a fixed number of chefs in your kitchen - good for steady workloads.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPoolTypes {
    public static void demonstrateFixedThreadPool() {
        System.out.println("=== Fixed Thread Pool Demo ===");
        
        // Always maintains exactly 4 threads
        ExecutorService fixedPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
            final int taskNum = i;
            fixedPool.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Fixed pool task " + taskNum + " on " + 
                                   Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }
        
        fixedPool.shutdown();
    }
    
    public static void demonstrateCachedThreadPool() {
        System.out.println("\n=== Cached Thread Pool Demo ===");
        
        // Creates new threads as needed, reuses existing ones
        ExecutorService cachedPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
            final int taskNum = i;
            cachedPool.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Cached pool task " + taskNum + " on " + 
                                   Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }
        
        cachedPool.shutdown();
    }
    
    public static void demonstrateSingleThreadExecutor() {
        System.out.println("\n=== Single Thread Executor Demo ===");
        
        // Only one thread processes all tasks sequentially
        ExecutorService singleThreadExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int taskNum = i;
            singleThreadExecutor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Single thread task " + taskNum + " on " + 
                                   Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }
        
        singleThreadExecutor.shutdown();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        demonstrateFixedThreadPool();
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        
        demonstrateCachedThreadPool();
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        
        demonstrateSingleThreadExecutor();
    }
}
```

#### 2. Scheduled Thread Pool
Like having a scheduler that can run tasks at specific times or intervals - perfect for recurring tasks.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ScheduledExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);
        
        System.out.println("Starting scheduled tasks...");
        
        // Schedule a one-time task with delay
        scheduler.schedule(() -> {
            System.out.println("One-time task executed after 3 seconds");
        }, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        
        // Schedule a recurring task (fixed rate)
        ScheduledFuture<?> recurringTask = scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
            System.out.println("Recurring task executed at " + 
                               java.time.LocalTime.now());
        }, 1, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // Start after 1 second, repeat every 2 seconds
        
        // Schedule a task with fixed delay between executions
        scheduler.scheduleWithFixedDelay(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fixed delay task executed");
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // This affects the next execution time
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        }, 2, 3, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // 3 seconds delay AFTER each execution completes
        
        // Let it run for 15 seconds then shutdown
        Thread.sleep(15000);
        
        System.out.println("Cancelling recurring task...");
        recurringTask.cancel(false); // Don't interrupt if running
        
        scheduler.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Scheduler shut down");
    }
}
```

### Future and Callable - Getting Results Back

Sometimes you need to get a result back from your thread, not just execute a task. It's like ordering a custom cake and waiting for the baker to tell you it's ready and how much it costs.

**Runnable vs Callable**:
- **Runnable**: Like giving instructions "do this work" (no return value)
- **Callable**: Like asking "do this work and tell me the result"

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class CalculationTask implements Callable<Integer> {
    private int number;
    private String taskName;
    
    public CalculationTask(int number, String taskName) {
        this.number = number;
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Integer call() throws Exception {
        System.out.println(taskName + " started calculating square of " + number);
        
        // Simulate complex calculation
        Thread.sleep(1000 + (int)(Math.random() * 2000));
        
        int result = number * number;
        System.out.println(taskName + " finished: " + number + "² = " + result);
        return result;
    }
}

public class FutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        List<Future<Integer>> futures = new ArrayList<>();
        
        System.out.println("Submitting calculation tasks...\n");
        
        // Submit multiple calculation tasks
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            Callable<Integer> task = new CalculationTask(i, "Task-" + i);
            Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
            futures.add(future);
        }
        
        System.out.println("All tasks submitted. Waiting for results...\n");
        
        // Collect results as they become available
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < futures.size(); i++) {
            try {
                // get() blocks until the result is available
                Integer result = futures.get(i).get();
                totalSum += result;
                System.out.println("Received result from Task-" + (i+1) + ": " + result);
                
                // You can also check if a task is done without blocking
                if (i < futures.size() - 1) {
                    Future<Integer> nextFuture = futures.get(i + 1);
                    if (nextFuture.isDone()) {
                        System.out.println("Task-" + (i+2) + " is already complete!");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Task-" + (i+2) + " is still running...");
                    }
                }
                
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.out.println("Main thread was interrupted");
                break;
            } catch (ExecutionException e) {
                System.out.println("Task threw an exception: " + e.getCause());
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println("\nSum of all squares: " + totalSum);
        
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Key Points about Future**:
- `get()` blocks until the result is available
- `get(timeout, unit)` blocks with a timeout
- `isDone()` checks if task is complete (non-blocking)
- `cancel(mayInterruptIfRunning)` attempts to cancel the task
- `isCancelled()` checks if task was cancelled

### CompletableFuture - The Modern Approach

`CompletableFuture` is like having a smart assistant who can chain tasks together and handle complex workflows. It's the modern way to handle asynchronous operations.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("=== CompletableFuture Demo ===\n");
        
        // Simple async operation
        CompletableFuture<String> future1 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Fetching user data...");
            sleep(2000);
            return "User: John Doe";
        });
        
        // Chain operations together
        CompletableFuture<String> future2 = future1.thenApply(user -> {
            System.out.println("Processing: " + user);
            sleep(1000);
            return user + " (Processed)";
        });
        
        // Handle the result
        future2.thenAccept(result -> {
            System.out.println("Final result: " + result);
        });
        
        // Combining multiple futures
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future3 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Calculating price...");
            sleep(1500);
            return 100;
        });
        
        CompletableFuture<Integer> future4 = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Calculating tax...");
            sleep(1000);
            return 15;
        });
        
        // Combine results from multiple futures
        CompletableFuture<String> combined = future3.thenCombine(future4, (price, tax) -> {
            int total = price + tax;
            return String.format("Price: $%d, Tax: $%d, Total: $%d", price, tax, total);
        });
        
        // Wait for all to complete
        try {
            System.out.println("Waiting for all operations to complete...\n");
            String finalResult = combined.get(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            System.out.println("Combined result: " + finalResult);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        // Exception handling
        CompletableFuture<String> futureWithException = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Random failure!");
            }
            return "Success!";
        }).exceptionally(throwable -> {
            System.out.println("Caught exception: " + throwable.getMessage());
            return "Default value due to exception";
        });
        
        try {
            System.out.println("Exception handling result: " + futureWithException.get());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
    
    private static void sleep(int milliseconds) {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(milliseconds);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

## 8. Advanced Concurrency Utilities {#advanced-utilities}

Java provides several advanced synchronization utilities that solve common concurrency patterns. These are like specialized tools in a toolbox - each designed for specific scenarios.

### CountDownLatch - Waiting for Multiple Events

Imagine you're organizing a group photo. You need to wait for all family members to get ready before taking the picture. `CountDownLatch` is perfect for this "wait for N events to complete" scenario.

**Use Cases**:
- Waiting for multiple services to start up
- Coordinating the start of multiple threads
- Waiting for multiple tasks to complete before proceeding

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class CountDownLatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        int numberOfWorkers = 3;
        CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1); // All workers wait for this
        CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(numberOfWorkers); // Main waits for all workers
        
        // Create and start worker threads
        for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfWorkers; i++) {
            Thread worker = new Thread(new Worker(startSignal, doneSignal, "Worker-" + i));
            worker.start();
        }
        
        System.out.println("All workers created. Preparing to start work...");
        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate preparation time
        
        System.out.println("Starting all workers simultaneously!");
        startSignal.countDown(); // Release all workers at once!
        
        System.out.println("Main thread waiting for all workers to complete...");
        doneSignal.await(); // Wait for all workers to finish
        
        System.out.println("All workers completed! Main thread proceeding.");
    }
}

class Worker implements Runnable {
    private final CountDownLatch startSignal;
    private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
    private final String name;
    
    public Worker(CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal, String name) {
        this.startSignal = startSignal;
        this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println(name + " is ready and waiting for start signal...");
            startSignal.await(); // Wait for the start signal
            
            System.out.println(name + " started working!");
            
            // Simulate work with random duration
            int workTime = 2000 + (int)(Math.random() * 3000);
            Thread.sleep(workTime);
            
            System.out.println(name + " finished work (took " + workTime + "ms)");
            
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.out.println(name + " was interrupted");
        } finally {
            doneSignal.countDown(); // Signal completion
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Points about CountDownLatch**:
- **One-time use**: Cannot be reset (use `CyclicBarrier` if you need reusability)
- **Thread-safe**: Multiple threads can safely call `countDown()`
- **Flexible**: Threads can count down without waiting, or wait without counting down

### CyclicBarrier - Synchronized Phases

Think of `CyclicBarrier` as a meeting point where everyone must arrive before anyone can proceed to the next phase. It's like a group of hikers who agree to wait at each checkpoint until everyone catches up.

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-phase algorithms where all threads must complete each phase before any can start the next
- Parallel processing where you need synchronization points
- Games where all players must be ready before starting each round

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;
import java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException;

public class CyclicBarrierExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numberOfHikers = 4;
        
        // Create barrier with action to run when all threads reach it
        CyclicBarrier checkpoint = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfHikers, () -> {
            System.out.println("All hikers reached checkpoint! Taking group photo...\n");
        });
        
        // Start hikers
        for (int i = 1; i <= numberOfHikers; i++) {
            Thread hiker = new Thread(new Hiker(checkpoint, "Hiker-" + i));
            hiker.start();
        }
    }
}

class Hiker implements Runnable {
    private final CyclicBarrier checkpoint;
    private final String name;
    
    public Hiker(CyclicBarrier checkpoint, String name) {
        this.checkpoint = checkpoint;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            // Phase 1: Hike to first checkpoint
            int hikeTime1 = 1000 + (int)(Math.random() * 3000);
            System.out.println(name + " hiking to checkpoint 1...");
            Thread.sleep(hikeTime1);
            System.out.println(name + " reached checkpoint 1 (took " + hikeTime1 + "ms)");
            
            checkpoint.await(); // Wait for all hikers
            
            // Phase 2: Hike to second checkpoint
            int hikeTime2 = 1500 + (int)(Math.random() * 2500);
            System.out.println(name + " hiking to checkpoint 2...");
            Thread.sleep(hikeTime2);
            System.out.println(name + " reached checkpoint 2 (took " + hikeTime2 + "ms)");
            
            checkpoint.await(); // Wait for all hikers again
            
            // Phase 3: Final hike
            System.out.println(name + " hiking to summit...");
            Thread.sleep(1000 + (int)(Math.random() * 2000));
            System.out.println(name + " reached the summit!");
            
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            System.out.println(name + " was interrupted during hike");
        } catch (BrokenBarrierException e) {
            System.out.println(name + " encountered broken barrier: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

**CyclicBarrier vs CountDownLatch**:
- **CyclicBarrier**: Reusable, all threads wait for each other
- **CountDownLatch**: One-time use, some threads wait for others to signal

### Semaphore - Controlling Resource Access

A `Semaphore` is like a parking lot with a limited number of spaces. It controls how many threads can access a resource simultaneously. When all permits are taken, new threads must wait until someone releases a permit.

**Use Cases**:
- Limiting database connections
- Controlling access to expensive resources
- Implementing resource pools
- Rate limiting

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class SemaphoreExample {
    // Only 2 threads can access the printer simultaneously
    private static final Semaphore printerSemaphore = new Semaphore(2);
    private static int documentCounter = 0;
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Office printer available (2 simultaneous users allowed)\n");
        
        // Create 6 employees trying to use the printer
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            Thread employee = new Thread(new Employee("Employee-" + i));
            employee.start();
        }
    }
    
    static class Employee implements Runnable {
        private final String name;
        
        public Employee(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(name + " needs to print a document");
                System.out.println(name + " waiting for printer... (Available permits: " + 
                                   printerSemaphore.availablePermits() + ")");
                
                // Try to acquire a printer permit
                printerSemaphore.acquire();
                
                System.out.println(name + " acquired printer access");
                
                // Simulate printing
                int printTime = 2000 + (int)(Math.random() * 3000);
                System.out.println(name + " printing document #" + (++documentCounter) + 
                                   " (will take " + printTime + "ms)");
                Thread.sleep(printTime);
                
                System.out.println(name + " finished printing");
                
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                System.out.println(name + " was interrupted while waiting for printer");
            } finally {
                // Always release the permit in finally block
                printerSemaphore.release();
                System.out.println(name + " released printer (Available permits: " + 
                                   printerSemaphore.availablePermits() + ")\n");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### ReentrantLock - Advanced Locking

While `synchronized` is simple and effective, `ReentrantLock` provides more advanced features. Think of it as upgrading from a basic door lock to a smart lock with additional features.

**Advantages of ReentrantLock**:
- **Try-lock with timeout**: Don't wait forever for a lock
- **Interruptible locking**: Can be interrupted while waiting
- **Fairness**: Can guarantee first-come-first-served
- **Condition variables**: More flexible than `wait()`/`notify()`
- **Lock monitoring**: Can check if lock is held, queue length, etc.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ReentrantLockExample {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Fair lock
    private final Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
    private final Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
    
    private final int[] buffer = new int[5];
    private int count = 0;
    private int putIndex = 0;
    private int takeIndex = 0;
    
    public void put(int item) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            // Wait while buffer is full
            while (count == buffer.length) {
                System.out.println("Buffer full, producer waiting...");
                notFull.await();
            }
            
            buffer[putIndex] = item;
            putIndex = (putIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
            count++;
            
            System.out.println("Produced: " + item + " (Buffer size: " + count + ")");
            notEmpty.signal(); // Wake up a consumer
            
        } finally {
            lock.unlock(); // Always unlock in finally
        }
    }
    
    public int take() throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            // Wait while buffer is empty
            while (count == 0) {
                System.out.println("Buffer empty, consumer waiting...");
                notEmpty.await();
            }
            
            int item = buffer[takeIndex];
            takeIndex = (takeIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
            count--;
            
            System.out.println("Consumed: " + item + " (Buffer size: " + count + ")");
            notFull.signal(); // Wake up a producer
            
            return item;
            
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
    
    // Demonstrate try-lock with timeout
    public boolean tryPutWithTimeout(int item, long timeoutMs) {
        try {
            if (lock.tryLock(timeoutMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
                try {
                    if (count < buffer.length) {
                        put(item);
                        return true;
                    }
                    return false;
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("Could not acquire lock within " + timeoutMs + "ms");
                return false;
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ReentrantLockExample buffer = new ReentrantLockExample();
        
        // Producer thread
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    buffer.put(i);
                    Thread.sleep(500);
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });
        
        // Consumer thread
        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    buffer.take();
                    Thread.sleep(800); // Consumer is slower
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        });
        
        producer.start();
        consumer.start();
        
        producer.join();
        consumer.join();
        
        System.out.println("Producer-Consumer example completed");
    }
}
```

**When to use ReentrantLock vs synchronized**:
- Use `synchronized` for simple cases (it's easier and less error-prone)
- Use `ReentrantLock` when you need advanced features like timeouts, interruptibility, or multiple conditions

## 9. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls {#best-practices}

Learning about threads is like learning to drive - knowing the rules is just the beginning. Experience and best practices help you avoid accidents and drive efficiently.

### Best Practices

#### 1. Use High-Level Concurrency Utilities

**Don't do this** (manual thread management):
```java
// Creating threads manually is expensive and hard to manage
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    new Thread(() -> {
        // Do some work
        processTask();
    }).start();
}
```

**Do this** (use thread pools):
```java
// Thread pools reuse threads and manage resources efficiently
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
try {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        executor.submit(() -> processTask());
    }
} finally {
    executor.shutdown();
    try {
        if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        executor.shutdownNow();
    }
}
```

**Why thread pools are better**:
- **Resource management**: Prevents creating too many threads
- **Performance**: Reuses existing threads instead of creating new ones
- **Control**: Better monitoring and management capabilities
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup of resources

#### 2. Handle InterruptedException Properly

Interruption is Java's way of asking a thread to stop what it's doing. It's polite - like tapping someone on the shoulder rather than yanking them away from their work.

**Wrong way** (swallowing the exception):
```java
public void badInterruptHandling() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // This is bad - we're ignoring the interrupt!
        System.out.println("Sleep interrupted");
    }
}
```

**Correct way** (preserve interrupt status):
```java
public void goodInterruptHandling() {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        // Restore the interrupt status
        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        
        // Handle the interruption appropriately
        System.out.println("Thread was interrupted, cleaning up...");
        throw new RuntimeException("Thread interrupted", e);
    }
}

// Alternative: propagate the exception
public void methodThatCanBeInterrupted() throws InterruptedException {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Let caller handle InterruptedException
}
```

**Why this matters**:
- Other code might be checking the interrupt status
- Frameworks like thread pools rely on proper interrupt handling
- It's part of the cooperative cancellation mechanism

#### 3. Use Immutable Objects When Possible

Immutable objects are naturally thread-safe because they can't be modified after creation. It's like having a read-only document that everyone can safely access simultaneously.

**Mutable and problematic**:
```java
class MutableCounter {
    private int value;
    
    public void increment() {
        value++; // Race condition possible
    }
    
    public int getValue() {
        return value; // Might see inconsistent value
    }
}
```

**Immutable and safe**:
```java
public final class ImmutableCounter {
    private final int value;
    
    public ImmutableCounter(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public int getValue() {
        return value; // Always safe to read
    }
    
    public ImmutableCounter increment() {
        return new ImmutableCounter(value + 1); // Returns new instance
    }
}

// Usage
ImmutableCounter counter = new ImmutableCounter(0);
counter = counter.increment(); // Get new instance with incremented value
```

**Benefits of immutability**:
- **Thread-safe by default**: No synchronization needed
- **Easier to reason about**: State never changes unexpectedly
- **Cacheable**: Can safely cache hash codes and other computed values
- **Shareable**: Multiple threads can share references safely

#### 4. Prefer Concurrent Collections

Java provides thread-safe alternatives to regular collections that are optimized for concurrent access.

**Manual synchronization**:
```java
// This works but is inefficient
Map<String, Integer> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

// Still need external synchronization for compound operations
synchronized (syncMap) {
    if (!syncMap.containsKey("key")) {
        syncMap.put("key", 1);
    } else {
        syncMap.put("key", syncMap.get("key") + 1);
    }
}
```

**Use concurrent collections**:
```java
// ConcurrentHashMap is designed for concurrent access
ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

// Atomic compound operations
concurrentMap.compute("key", (k, v) -> v == null ? 1 : v + 1);
// Or even simpler for counting:
concurrentMap.merge("key", 1, Integer::sum);

// Other useful concurrent collections
BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>();
CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
```

#### 5. Use Atomic Variables for Simple Operations

For simple operations like counters, flags, or references, atomic variables are more efficient than synchronization.

**Synchronized for simple operations**:
```java
class SynchronizedCounter {
    private int count = 0;
    
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    
    public synchronized int get() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Atomic variables**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

class AtomicCounter {
    private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
    
    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet(); // Lock-free, more efficient
    }
    
    public int get() {
        return count.get();
    }
    
    // Atomic operations provide additional useful methods
    public int getAndIncrement() {
        return count.getAndIncrement();
    }
    
    public boolean compareAndSet(int expected, int newValue) {
        return count.compareAndSet(expected, newValue);
    }
}
```

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

#### 1. Race Conditions

**The Problem**: Multiple threads accessing shared data without proper synchronization.

**Example of the problem**:
```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) { // Check
            // Another thread might withdraw here!
            balance -= amount;   // Act - race condition!
        }
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance; // Might see intermediate state
    }
}
```

**The Solution**: Synchronize the entire operation:
```java
class SafeBankAccount {
    private double balance;
    
    public synchronized void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount; // Now this is atomic
        }
    }
    
    public synchronized double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Memory Visibility Issues

**The Problem**: Changes made by one thread might not be visible to other threads.

**Example of the problem**:
```java
class VisibilityProblem {
    private boolean flag = false;
    
    public void setFlag() {
        flag = true; // Other threads might not see this change!
    }
    
    public void waitForFlag() {
        while (!flag) { // Might loop forever!
            // Waiting...
        }
    }
}
```

**The Solution**: Use `volatile` or synchronization:
```java
class VisibilitySolution {
    private volatile boolean flag = false; // Ensures visibility
    
    public void setFlag() {
        flag = true; // Now visible to all threads immediately
    }
    
    public void waitForFlag() {
        while (!flag) {
            // Will see the change from other threads
        }
    }
}
```

**When to use volatile**:
- For simple flags or status indicators
- When only one thread writes, others only read
- For publishing immutable objects

#### 3. Deadlock

**The Problem**: Two or more threads waiting for each other forever.

**Classic deadlock scenario**:
```java
class DeadlockProne {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Do work
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock2) { // Different order - potential deadlock!
            synchronized (lock1) {
                // Do work
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Solutions to prevent deadlock**:

**Solution 1: Lock ordering**
```java
class DeadlockPrevention1 {
    private final Object lock1 = new Object();
    private final Object lock2 = new Object();
    
    public void method1() {
        synchronized (lock1) { // Always acquire lock1 first
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Do work
            }
        }
    }
    
    public void method2() {
        synchronized (lock1) { // Same order as method1
            synchronized (lock2) {
                // Do work
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Solution 2: Timeout-based locking**
```java
class DeadlockPrevention2 {
    private final ReentrantLock lock1 = new ReentrantLock();
    private final ReentrantLock lock2 = new ReentrantLock();
    
    public boolean method1() {
        try {
            if (lock1.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                try {
                    if (lock2.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                        try {
                            // Do work
                            return true;
                        } finally {
                            lock2.unlock();
                        }
                    }
                } finally {
                    lock1.unlock();
                }
            }
            return false; // Couldn't acquire locks
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Resource Leaks

**The Problem**: Not properly cleaning up threads and resources.

**Resource leak**:
```java
public void badResourceManagement() {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    executor.submit(() -> doWork());
    // Missing: executor.shutdown() - threads will live forever!
}
```

**Proper resource management**:
```java
public void goodResourceManagement() {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
    try {
        executor.submit(() -> doWork());
        // Do more work...
    } finally {
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
                if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                    System.err.println("Executor did not terminate gracefully");
                }
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}
```

**Try-with-resources for custom resources**:
```java
class ManagedExecutor implements AutoCloseable {
    private final ExecutorService executor;
    
    public ManagedExecutor(int poolSize) {
        this.executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
    }
    
    public void submit(Runnable task) {
        executor.submit(task);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void close() {
        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

// Usage with try-with-resources
public void useResourceSafely() {
    try (ManagedExecutor executor = new ManagedExecutor(5)) {
        executor.submit(() -> doWork());
        // Executor will be automatically closed
    }
}
```

#### 5. Performance Anti-patterns

**Anti-pattern 1: Excessive synchronization**
```java
// Too much synchronization
class OverSynchronized {
    public synchronized void method1() {
        // Simple operation that doesn't need synchronization
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
    
    public synchronized int method2() {
        // Reading a simple variable
        return 42;
    }
}

// Synchronize only when necessary
class WellSynchronized {
    private volatile boolean flag;
    private final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
    
    public void method1() {
        System.out.println("Hello"); // No sync needed
    }
    
    public int method2() {
        return 42; // No sync needed for constants
    }
    
    public void setFlag(boolean value) {
        flag = value; // volatile ensures visibility
    }
    
    public void incrementCounter() {
        counter.incrementAndGet(); // Atomic operation
    }
}
```

### Advanced Synchronization Patterns

#### 1. Double-Checked Locking for Singleton

This pattern optimizes singleton creation for multithreaded environments:

```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {
        // Prevent instantiation
    }
    
    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) { // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Read-Write Locks

When you have many readers and few writers, `ReadWriteLock` can improve performance:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

class ReadWriteExample {
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private String data = "Initial data";
    
    public String readData() {
        lock.readLock().lock(); // Multiple readers can hold this simultaneously
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reading: " + data);
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate read time
            return data;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            return null;
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }
    
    public void writeData(String newData) {
        lock.writeLock().lock(); // Only one writer at a time
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " writing: " + newData);
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate write time
            this.data = newData;
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

## 10. Performance Considerations {#performance}

Understanding thread performance is like tuning a race car - you need to know what affects speed and how to optimize for your specific track conditions.

### Understanding Thread Overhead

Creating threads isn't free. Each thread consumes:
- **Memory**: Each thread has its own stack (typically 1MB on 64-bit JVMs)
- **CPU**: Context switching between threads has overhead
- **OS resources**: File descriptors, kernel data structures

### Monitoring Thread Performance

Java provides built-in tools to monitor thread performance. It's like having a dashboard in your car that shows engine performance.

```java
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;
import java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadPerformanceMonitor {
    
    public static void monitorThreads() {
        ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
        
        System.out.println("=== Thread Performance Metrics ===");
        System.out.println("Current Thread Count: " + threadBean.getThreadCount());
        System.out.println("Daemon Thread Count: " + threadBean.getDaemonThreadCount());
        System.out.println("Peak Thread Count: " + threadBean.getPeakThreadCount());
        System.out.println("Total Started Thread Count: " + threadBean.getTotalStartedThreadCount());
        
        // CPU time measurement (if supported)
        if (threadBean.isCurrentThreadCpuTimeSupported()) {
            long cpuTime = threadBean.getCurrentThreadCpuTime();
            long userTime = threadBean.getCurrentThreadUserTime();
            
            System.out.println("Current Thread CPU Time: " + cpuTime / 1_000_000 + " ms");
            System.out.println("Current Thread User Time: " + userTime / 1_000_000 + " ms");
            System.out.println("Current Thread System Time: " + (cpuTime - userTime) / 1_000_000 + " ms");
        }
        
        // Contention monitoring (if enabled)
        if (threadBean.isThreadContentionMonitoringSupported()) {
            threadBean.setThreadContentionMonitoringEnabled(true);
            System.out.println("Thread contention monitoring enabled");
        }
        
        System.out.println("=====================================\n");
    }
    
    public static void demonstrateThreadOverhead() {
        System.out.println("=== Thread Creation Overhead Demo ===");
        
        // Measure thread creation overhead
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
                // Minimal work
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
            thread.start();
            try {
                thread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                break;
            }
        }
        
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Time to create and run 1000 threads: " + 
                           (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000 + " ms");
        
        // Compare with thread pool
        startTime = System.nanoTime();
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(1000);
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                } finally {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            });
        }
        
        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {

        endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Time to run 1000 tasks in thread pool: " + 
                           (endTime - startTime) / 1_000_000 + " ms");
        
        executor.shutdown();
        System.out.println("Thread pool is much faster for many small tasks!\n");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        monitorThreads();
        
        // Create some threads and monitor again
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(2000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }
        
        System.out.println("After creating thread pool and submitting tasks:");
        monitorThreads();
        
        demonstrateThreadOverhead();
        
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Optimal Thread Pool Sizing

Choosing the right thread pool size is like choosing the right number of lanes on a highway - too few and you get traffic jams, too many and you waste resources.

```java
public class ThreadPoolSizing {
    
    // For CPU-intensive tasks (no I/O blocking)
    public static int getCpuIntensivePoolSize() {
        // Rule of thumb: Number of CPU cores
        return Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
    }
    
    // For I/O-intensive tasks (lots of waiting)
    public static int getIoIntensivePoolSize() {
        // Rule of thumb: 2x number of CPU cores (or more)
        return Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2;
    }
    
    // More precise formula: Threads = CPU cores * (1 + Wait time / CPU time)
    public static int getOptimalPoolSize(double waitTime, double cpuTime) {
        int cpuCores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        return (int) Math.ceil(cpuCores * (1 + waitTime / cpuTime));
    }
    
    // Dynamic pool sizing based on workload
    public static ThreadPoolExecutor createAdaptivePool() {
        int corePoolSize = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        int maximumPoolSize = corePoolSize * 4;
        long keepAliveTime = 60L;
        TimeUnit unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS;
        BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(100);
        
        return new ThreadPoolExecutor(
            corePoolSize,
            maximumPoolSize,
            keepAliveTime,
            unit,
            workQueue,
            new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy() // Backpressure handling
        );
    }
    
    public static void demonstratePoolSizing() {
        System.out.println("=== Thread Pool Sizing Guidelines ===");
        System.out.println("Available CPU cores: " + Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
        System.out.println("CPU-intensive tasks: " + getCpuIntensivePoolSize() + " threads");
        System.out.println("I/O-intensive tasks: " + getIoIntensivePoolSize() + " threads");
        
        // Example calculations for different scenarios
        System.out.println("\nOptimal sizes for different wait/CPU ratios:");
        System.out.println("50% I/O (wait:cpu = 1:1): " + getOptimalPoolSize(1.0, 1.0) + " threads");
        System.out.println("75% I/O (wait:cpu = 3:1): " + getOptimalPoolSize(3.0, 1.0) + " threads");
        System.out.println("90% I/O (wait:cpu = 9:1): " + getOptimalPoolSize(9.0, 1.0) + " threads");
        
        // Demonstrate adaptive pool
        ThreadPoolExecutor adaptivePool = createAdaptivePool();
        System.out.println("\nAdaptive pool created:");
        System.out.println("Core pool size: " + adaptivePool.getCorePoolSize());
        System.out.println("Maximum pool size: " + adaptivePool.getMaximumPoolSize());
        System.out.println("Keep-alive time: " + adaptivePool.getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit.SECONDS) + " seconds");
        
        adaptivePool.shutdown();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        demonstratePoolSizing();
    }
}
```

### Performance Testing Framework

Here's a simple framework for testing thread performance:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

public class ThreadPerformanceTester {
    
    public static class PerformanceResult {
        private final String testName;
        private final long executionTimeMs;
        private final long tasksCompleted;
        private final double throughput;
        
        public PerformanceResult(String testName, long executionTimeMs, long tasksCompleted) {
            this.testName = testName;
            this.executionTimeMs = executionTimeMs;
            this.tasksCompleted = tasksCompleted;
            this.throughput = (double) tasksCompleted / executionTimeMs * 1000; // tasks per second
        }
        
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return String.format("%s: %d tasks in %d ms (%.2f tasks/sec)", 
                               testName, tasksCompleted, executionTimeMs, throughput);
        }
    }
    
    public static PerformanceResult testExecutorPerformance(
            String testName, 
            ExecutorService executor, 
            int numberOfTasks, 
            Runnable taskToRun) throws InterruptedException {
        
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfTasks);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfTasks; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    taskToRun.run();
                } finally {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            });
        }
        
        latch.await(); // Wait for all tasks to complete
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        return new PerformanceResult(testName, endTime - startTime, numberOfTasks);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        final int numberOfTasks = 10000;
        
        // Define different types of work
        Runnable cpuIntensiveTask = () -> {
            // Simulate CPU-intensive work
            double result = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                result += Math.sqrt(i);
            }
        };
        
        Runnable ioIntensiveTask = () -> {
            // Simulate I/O-intensive work
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
        };
        
        System.out.println("=== Performance Comparison ===\n");
        
        // Test different pool sizes for CPU-intensive tasks
        System.out.println("CPU-Intensive Tasks:");
        testPoolSize(numberOfTasks, cpuIntensiveTask, "CPU-Intensive");
        
        System.out.println("\nI/O-Intensive Tasks:");
        testPoolSize(numberOfTasks, ioIntensiveTask, "I/O-Intensive");
    }
    
    private static void testPoolSize(int numberOfTasks, Runnable task, String taskType) 
            throws InterruptedException {
        int cpuCores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
        int[] poolSizes = {1, cpuCores, cpuCores * 2, cpuCores * 4};
        
        for (int poolSize : poolSizes) {
            ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
            try {
                PerformanceResult result = testExecutorPerformance(
                    taskType + " (" + poolSize + " threads)", 
                    executor, 
                    numberOfTasks, 
                    task
                );
                System.out.println(result);
            } finally {
                executor.shutdown();
                executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Memory and GC Considerations

Threads affect garbage collection and memory usage:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ThreadMemoryConsiderations {
    
    // Demonstrate thread-local variables and their memory impact
    private static final ThreadLocal<StringBuilder> THREAD_LOCAL_BUFFER = 
        ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> new StringBuilder(1000));
    
    public static void demonstrateThreadLocalMemory() {
        System.out.println("=== Thread-Local Memory Demo ===");
        
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                StringBuilder buffer = THREAD_LOCAL_BUFFER.get();
                buffer.setLength(0); // Clear previous content
                buffer.append("Task ").append(taskId).append(" data");
                
                System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + 
                                 " using buffer: " + buffer.toString());
            });
        }
        
        executor.shutdown();
        
        // Important: Clean up thread-local variables to prevent memory leaks
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -> {
            THREAD_LOCAL_BUFFER.remove();
        }));
    }
    
    // Demonstrate object allocation patterns in multithreaded code
    public static void demonstrateAllocationPatterns() {
        System.out.println("\n=== Allocation Patterns Demo ===");
        
        // Pattern 1: Shared mutable objects (problematic)
        StringBuilder sharedBuffer = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Pattern 2: Immutable objects (GC-friendly but more allocations)
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                // Each task creates new objects (immutable pattern)
                String result = "Result from task " + taskId;
                System.out.println(result);
            });
        }
        
        executor.shutdown();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        demonstrateThreadLocalMemory();
        demonstrateAllocationPatterns();
    }
}
```

### Real-World Threading Patterns

#### 1. Producer-Consumer with Multiple Producers and Consumers

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class MultiProducerConsumerExample {
    private static final BlockingQueue<String> queue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10);
    private static final AtomicBoolean isProducing = new AtomicBoolean(true);
    
    static class Producer implements Runnable {
        private final String name;
        
        public Producer(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                try {
                    String item = name + "-Item-" + i;
                    queue.put(item);
                    System.out.println(name + " produced: " + item);
                    Thread.sleep(500 + (int)(Math.random() * 1000));
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(name + " finished producing");
        }
    }
    
    static class Consumer implements Runnable {
        private final String name;
        
        public Consumer(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (isProducing.get() || !queue.isEmpty()) {
                try {
                    String item = queue.poll(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
                    if (item != null) {
                        System.out.println(name + " consumed: " + item);
                        Thread.sleep(300 + (int)(Math.random() * 700));
                    }
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    return;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(name + " finished consuming");
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        
        // Start multiple producers
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Producer("Producer-" + i));
        }
        
        // Start multiple consumers
        for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Consumer("Consumer-" + i));
        }
        
        // Wait for producers to finish
        Thread.sleep(8000);
        isProducing.set(false);
        
        // Wait for consumers to finish
        Thread.sleep(5000);
        
        executor.shutdown();
        executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
        
        System.out.println("All tasks completed. Remaining items in queue: " + queue.size());
    }
}
```

#### 2. Parallel Processing with Fork-Join Framework

For computational tasks that can be divided into smaller subtasks, the Fork-Join framework provides excellent performance:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

public class ForkJoinExample {
    
    static class MergeSort extends RecursiveTask<int[]> {
        private final int[] array;
        private final int start;
        private final int end;
        private static final int THRESHOLD = 1000; // Switch to sequential below this size
        
        public MergeSort(int[] array, int start, int end) {
            this.array = array;
            this.start = start;
            this.end = end;
        }
        
        @Override
        protected int[] compute() {
            if (end - start <= THRESHOLD) {
                // Small enough - sort sequentially
                return sequentialSort(array, start, end);
            }
            
            // Large enough - divide and conquer
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            
            MergeSort leftTask = new MergeSort(array, start, mid);
            MergeSort rightTask = new MergeSort(array, mid, end);
            
            // Fork the left task (run in parallel)
            leftTask.fork();
            
            // Compute right task in current thread
            int[] rightResult = rightTask.compute();
            
            // Join the left task (wait for result)
            int[] leftResult = leftTask.join();
            
            // Merge results
            return merge(leftResult, rightResult);
        }
        
        private int[] sequentialSort(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
            int[] result = new int[end - start];
            System.arraycopy(arr, start, result, 0, end - start);
            java.util.Arrays.sort(result);
            return result;
        }
        
        private int[] merge(int[] left, int[] right) {
            int[] result = new int[left.length + right.length];
            int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
            
            while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
                if (left[i] <= right[j]) {
                    result[k++] = left[i++];
                } else {
                    result[k++] = right[j++];
                }
            }
            
            while (i < left.length) result[k++] = left[i++];
            while (j < right.length) result[k++] = right[j++];
            
            return result;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = new int[100000];
        
        // Fill with random numbers
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            array[i] = (int)(Math.random() * 10000);
        }
        
        System.out.println("Sorting " + array.length + " elements...");
        
        // Sequential sort timing
        int[] sequentialArray = array.clone();
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        java.util.Arrays.sort(sequentialArray);
        long sequentialTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        
        // Parallel sort timing
        int[] parallelArray = array.clone();
        startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        MergeSort task = new MergeSort(parallelArray, 0, parallelArray.length);
        int[] result = pool.invoke(task);
        
        long parallelTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime;
        
        System.out.println("Sequential sort: " + sequentialTime + " ms");
        System.out.println("Parallel sort: " + parallelTime + " ms");
        System.out.println("Speedup: " + (double)sequentialTime / parallelTime + "x");
        
        pool.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Advanced Patterns and Real-World Examples

### 1. Thread-Safe Singleton Pattern

```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {
        // Simulate expensive initialization
        try {
            Thread.sleep(100);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
    
    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) { // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    public void doWork() {
        System.out.println("Working in singleton: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

// Test the singleton
public class SingletonTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(10);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    ThreadSafeSingleton singleton = ThreadSafeSingleton.getInstance();
                    singleton.doWork();
                    System.out.println("Instance hash: " + singleton.hashCode());
                } finally {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            });
        }
        
        latch.await();
        executor.shutdown();
        
        System.out.println("All instances should have the same hash code");
    }
}
```

### 2. Worker Pool Pattern for Task Processing

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class WorkerPoolPattern {
    
    static class Task {
        private final int id;
        private final int processingTime;
        
        public Task(int id, int processingTime) {
            this.id = id;
            this.processingTime = processingTime;
        }
        
        public void process() throws InterruptedException {
            System.out.println("Processing task " + id + " on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            Thread.sleep(processingTime);
            System.out.println("Completed task " + id);
        }
        
        public int getId() { return id; }
    }
    
    static class WorkerPool {
        private final ExecutorService executor;
        private final BlockingQueue<Task> taskQueue;
        private final AtomicInteger completedTasks = new AtomicInteger(0);
        private final int numberOfWorkers;
        
        public WorkerPool(int numberOfWorkers, int queueCapacity) {
            this.numberOfWorkers = numberOfWorkers;
            this.executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfWorkers);
            this.taskQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(queueCapacity);
            
            // Start worker threads
            for (int i = 0; i < numberOfWorkers; i++) {
                executor.submit(new Worker("Worker-" + i));
            }
        }
        
        public boolean submitTask(Task task) {
            return taskQueue.offer(task);
        }
        
        public void shutdown() {
            // Stop accepting new tasks
            executor.shutdown();
            
            // Add poison pills to stop workers
            for (int i = 0; i < numberOfWorkers; i++) {
                taskQueue.offer(new Task(-1, 0)); // Poison pill
            }
        }
        
        public int getCompletedTaskCount() {
            return completedTasks.get();

                        task.process();
                        completedTasks.incrementAndGet();
                        
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {

        System.out.println("Total completed tasks: " + pool.getCompletedTaskCount());
    }
}
```

### 3. Timeout-Based Operations

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class TimeoutOperations {
    
    static class TimedService {
        private final ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
        
        public String performOperationWithTimeout(String operation, long timeoutMs) {
            Future<String> future = executor.submit(() -> {
                // Simulate operation that might take long time
                Thread.sleep(2000 + (int)(Math.random() * 3000));
                return "Result for: " + operation;
            });
            
            try {
                return future.get(timeoutMs, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
            } catch (TimeoutException e) {

            }
        }
        
        public void shutdown() {
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        TimedService service = new TimedService();
        
        // Test with different timeouts
        String[] operations = {"FastOp", "SlowOp", "MediumOp"};
        long[] timeouts = {1000, 5000, 3000};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < operations.length; i++) {
            String result = service.performOperationWithTimeout(operations[i], timeouts[i]);
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        }
        
        service.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## Testing Concurrent Code

Testing multithreaded code is challenging because race conditions might not appear consistently. Here are some strategies:

### 1. Stress Testing

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class ConcurrencyStressTester {
    
    public static void stressTestCounter(Counter counter, int numberOfThreads, int incrementsPerThread) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfThreads);
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfThreads);
        
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
            executor.submit(() -> {
                try {
                    for (int j = 0; j < incrementsPerThread; j++) {
                        counter.increment();
                    }
                } finally {
                    latch.countDown();
                }
            });
        }
        
        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        int expected = numberOfThreads * incrementsPerThread;
        int actual = counter.getCount();
        
        System.out.println("Stress Test Results:");
        System.out.println("Expected: " + expected);
        System.out.println("Actual: " + actual);
        System.out.println("Accuracy: " + (actual == expected ? "PASS" : "FAIL"));
        System.out.println("Time taken: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");
        System.out.println("Throughput: " + (actual * 1000.0 / (endTime - startTime)) + " ops/sec\n");
        
        executor.shutdown();
    }
    
    interface Counter {
        void increment();
        int getCount();
    }
    
    static class UnsafeCounter implements Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        public void increment() { count++; }
        public int getCount() { return count; }
    }
    
    static class SynchronizedCounter implements Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        public synchronized void increment() { count++; }
        public synchronized int getCount() { return count; }
    }
    
    static class AtomicCounterImpl implements Counter {
        private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
        public void increment() { count.incrementAndGet(); }
        public int getCount() { return count.get(); }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int threads = 10;
        int incrementsPerThread = 10000;
        
        System.out.println("=== Concurrency Stress Test ===\n");
        
        System.out.println("Testing Unsafe Counter:");
        stressTestCounter(new UnsafeCounter(), threads, incrementsPerThread);
        
        System.out.println("Testing Synchronized Counter:");
        stressTestCounter(new SynchronizedCounter(), threads, incrementsPerThread);
        
        System.out.println("Testing Atomic Counter:");
        stressTestCounter(new AtomicCounterImpl(), threads, incrementsPerThread);
    }
}
```

### 2. Thread Interruption and Graceful Shutdown

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class GracefulShutdownExample {
    
    static class InterruptibleTask implements Runnable {
        private final String name;

}
```

## Common Thread Debugging Techniques

### 1. Thread Dumps

Thread dumps are like taking a snapshot of all threads in your application at a specific moment:

```java
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;
import java.lang.management.ThreadInfo;
import java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean;

public class ThreadDumpAnalyzer {
    
    public static void printThreadDump() {
        ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
        ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadBean.dumpAllThreads(true, true);
        
        System.out.println("=== THREAD DUMP ===");
        System.out.println("Total threads: " + threadInfos.length);
        System.out.println("Active threads: " + threadBean.getThreadCount());
        System.out.println("Daemon threads: " + threadBean.getDaemonThreadCount());
        System.out.println();
        
        for (ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadInfos) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + threadInfo.getThreadName());
            System.out.println("  ID: " + threadInfo.getThreadId());
            System.out.println("  State: " + threadInfo.getThreadState());
            System.out.println("  Blocked time: " + threadInfo.getBlockedTime() + " ms");
            System.out.println("  Blocked count: " + threadInfo.getBlockedCount());
            System.out.println("  Wait time: " + threadInfo.getWaitedTime() + " ms");
            System.out.println("  Wait count: " + threadInfo.getWaitedCount());
            
            if (threadInfo.getLockName() != null) {
                System.out.println("  Waiting on lock: " + threadInfo.getLockName());
            }
            
            if (threadInfo.getLockOwnerName() != null) {
                System.out.println("  Lock owned by: " + threadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
            }
            
            StackTraceElement[] stackTrace = threadInfo.getStackTrace();
            for (int i = 0; i < Math.min(stackTrace.length, 5); i++) {
                System.out.println("    at " + stackTrace[i]);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Create some threads in different states
        Object lock = new Object();
        
        // Blocked thread
        Thread blockedThread = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(10000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
        });
        blockedThread.setName("BlockedThread");
        blockedThread.start();
        
        Thread.sleep(100); // Let first thread acquire lock
        
        // Thread waiting for the lock
        Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock) {
                System.out.println("Got the lock!");
            }
        });
        waitingThread.setName("WaitingThread");
        waitingThread.start();
        
        Thread.sleep(500); // Let threads get into their states
        
        printThreadDump();
        
        // Cleanup
        blockedThread.interrupt();
        waitingThread.interrupt();
    }
}
```

### 2. Deadlock Detection

```java
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;
import java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean;

public class DeadlockDetector {
    
    public static void detectDeadlocks() {
        ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();
        long[] deadlockedThreads = threadBean.findDeadlockedThreads();
        
        if (deadlockedThreads != null) {
            ThreadInfo[] threadInfos = threadBean.getThreadInfo(deadlockedThreads);
            
            System.out.println("DEADLOCK DETECTED!");
            System.out.println("Deadlocked threads: " + deadlockedThreads.length);
            
            for (ThreadInfo threadInfo : threadInfos) {
                System.out.println("Thread: " + threadInfo.getThreadName());
                System.out.println("  State: " + threadInfo.getThreadState());
                System.out.println("  Waiting on: " + threadInfo.getLockName());
                System.out.println("  Owned by: " + threadInfo.getLockOwnerName());
                System.out.println();
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("No deadlocks detected");
        }
    }
    
    // Deliberately create a deadlock for demonstration
    public static void createDeadlock() {
        Object lock1 = new Object();
        Object lock2 = new Object();
        
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock1");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 acquired lock2");
                }
            }
        });
        
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock2");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 acquired lock1");
                }
            }
        });
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        
        // Wait for deadlock to occur
        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
        
        detectDeadlocks();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        createDeadlock();
    }
}
```

## Modern Java Concurrency Features

### 1. Virtual Threads (Project Loom - Java 19+)

Virtual threads are lightweight threads that can scale to millions of instances:

```java
// Note: This requires Java 19+ with preview features enabled
public class VirtualThreadExample {
    
    public static void traditionalThreads() throws InterruptedException {
        long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        
        try (ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(200)) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                final int taskId = i;
                executor.submit(() -> {
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate I/O
                        if (taskId % 1000 == 0) {
                            System.out.println("Traditional thread completed task: " + taskId);
                        }
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                });
            }
        }
        
        long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println("Traditional threads took: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ms");

### 2. Structured Concurrency (Java 19+ Preview)

Structured concurrency ensures that related tasks have a clear parent-child relationship:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

// Note: This is a conceptual example - actual implementation requires Java 19+
public class StructuredConcurrencyExample {
    
    public static String fetchUserData(int userId) throws InterruptedException {
        // Simulate multiple concurrent operations for a user
        // In real structured concurrency, you'd use StructuredTaskScope
        
        CompletableFuture<String> profileFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
                return "Profile for user " + userId;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        });
        
        CompletableFuture<String> preferencesFuture = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(800);
                return "Preferences for user " + userId;
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                throw new RuntimeException(e);
            }
        });
        
        try {
            // Wait for all subtasks to complete
            String profile = profileFuture.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            String preferences = preferencesFuture.get(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
            
            return "UserData{" + profile + ", " + preferences + "}";
            
        } catch (TimeoutException e) {
            // Cancel all related tasks
            profileFuture.cancel(true);
            preferencesFuture.cancel(true);
            throw new InterruptedException("Timeout fetching user data");
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error fetching user data", e.getCause());
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String userData = fetchUserData(123);
            System.out.println("Successfully fetched: " + userData);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Operation was interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Mastering Java threads is a journey that transforms you from a sequential programmer into a concurrent systems architect. Throughout this comprehensive guide, we've explored the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and advanced techniques that make multithreading both powerful and challenging.

### Key Takeaways

**1. Start with High-Level APIs**: While understanding low-level threading concepts is important, modern Java development favors high-level concurrency utilities like `ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture`, and concurrent collections. These tools handle most of the complexity for you while providing better performance and reliability.

**2. Thread Safety is Non-Negotiable**: Always consider thread safety when multiple threads access shared data. Use synchronization mechanisms appropriately - `synchronized` for simplicity, `ReentrantLock` for advanced features, and atomic variables for simple operations.

**3. Performance Requires Measurement**: Don't guess at optimal thread pool sizes or performance characteristics. Use monitoring tools, conduct performance tests, and adjust based on your specific workload patterns.

**4. Resource Management is Critical**: Always properly shut down thread pools and clean up resources. Use try-with-resources patterns and shutdown hooks to prevent resource leaks.

**5. Handle Interruption Gracefully**: Proper interrupt handling is essential for responsive, well-behaved applications. Always restore interrupt status and clean up appropriately.

### The Path Forward

As you continue your journey with Java threads, remember that concurrent programming is both an art and a science. The concepts we've covered provide the foundation, but real expertise comes from:

- **Practice**: Build concurrent applications and experiment with different patterns
- **Monitoring**: Learn to use profiling tools like JVisualVM, JProfiler, or Java Mission Control
- **Reading**: Study the source code of concurrent libraries to understand implementation patterns
- **Testing**: Use tools like JCStress for testing concurrent code correctness

### Modern Alternatives and Future Directions

While threads remain fundamental to Java concurrency, newer paradigms are emerging:

- **Reactive Streams**: Libraries like RxJava and Project Reactor provide declarative approaches to asynchronous programming
- **Project Loom**: Virtual threads (lightweight threads) will revolutionize how we think about concurrency in Java
- **Async/Await patterns**: Frameworks are evolving to provide more intuitive asynchronous programming models

### Final Advice

Threading is like cooking a complex meal for many guests - it requires planning, coordination, and careful attention to timing. Start simple, understand the fundamentals, and gradually incorporate more advanced techniques as your applications demand them.

Remember: the goal isn't to use the most complex threading constructs available, but to choose the right tool for each specific problem. Sometimes a simple `synchronized` method is perfect; other times you need the full power of `CompletableFuture` and custom thread pools.

Most importantly, always prioritize correctness over performance. A slower program that works correctly is infinitely more valuable than a fast program that occasionally produces wrong results or deadlocks.

### Quick Reference Guide

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Solution** |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Simple counter/flag | `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean` |
| Complex shared state | `synchronized` methods/blocks |
| Multiple producers/consumers | `BlockingQueue` implementations |
| Task execution | `ExecutorService` with thread pools |
| Getting results from tasks | `Future`, `CompletableFuture` |
| Coordinating thread startup | `CountDownLatch` |
| Phase-based parallel algorithms | `CyclicBarrier` |
| Limiting resource access | `Semaphore` |
| Advanced locking needs | `ReentrantLock` |
| High-performance collections | `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` |

### Essential Thread Safety Checklist

Before deploying multithreaded code, ask yourself:

1. **Data Sharing**: What data is shared between threads?
2. **Race Conditions**: Can multiple threads modify shared data simultaneously?
3. **Visibility**: Will changes made by one thread be visible to others?
4. **Deadlock**: Is there any possibility of circular waiting for locks?
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Are all thread pools and resources properly shutdown?
6. **Exception Handling**: Are interruptions handled correctly?
7. **Testing**: Has the code been stress-tested under concurrent load?
